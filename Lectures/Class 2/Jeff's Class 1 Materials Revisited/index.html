      Hello and welcome to my site.

      You can write as much text as you want. For example:
    </p>
    <ol type="I">
      <li>Here's some text</li>
      <li class="before-list">Here's some text</li>
      <li>aaaand here's some text</li>
    </ol>
    <!DRY – Don't Repeat Yourself; keep your code minimal>
    <section class="afterword"> 
    	<h1 class="goodbye"> Goodbye </h1>
    	<p> Thanks for coming</p>
    	<p class="goodbye"> See you soon!</p> 
    </section> 
    <div class="afterword">
    	<p class="goodbye"> A second afterword?</p>
    </div>
    
    <!sections and divs dont' do much besides draw boxes on the page>
    <!These are called box elements>
    <!display: block means that the element streches across the page>
    <!Heights of blocks have a width of "auto" and a height of "0"> 
    <!general html elements have width of "0" and height of "0"> 
    <!margins put spaces btwn elements; browsers specify this element per element>
    <!four things take up space in an element: margin, border, padding, content>
    <!block vs incline: by default elements are inline not block - they'll just 
    sit nest to something – they have no default height or width and are only defined
    by what's in them>
    <!you can manipulate this by adding style="display:block" 
    you can do this with block elements also style="display:inline">
    <!there are other display types: float, relative, etc>
	
    
    <!div means nothing besides draw a box – they are meaningless> 
    <!divs should be used sparingly – use something meaningful if you can>
    <!sections are like divs, except slightly more meaningful> 
    <!indicates a new section with a similar theme w/rest of the content> 
    <!use elements only when necesary> 
    <!block elements stretch really far - change the width >
    <script src="script.js"></script>
