<!doctype html> 
<!hypertext has been around for a long time>
<!doctype declaration - tells the browser what kind of document it's reading> 
<!special kind of comment tag - does not need to be closed, not part of the structure>
<html> 
<!tags, id'd by angle brackets - tags come in pairs -pairs = an element> 
<!html tags are ALWAYS center-embedded, indenting code is good practice>
<!the html element always has two child elements - head and body>
	<head>
	<!the head is all about metadata, info abt the site - page title, what other files>
	<!need to be loaded, etc. it doesn't directly affect the page>
		<title>My AWESOME Website</title>
		<link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet">
		<!it's good practice to link the stylesheet in the head>
		<!link is a void element - no text content, no closing link tabs>
		<!link tags set up a relation w external docs, do not confuse with anchor tags>
		<!rel stands for relation, how is the file related, here = stylesheet>
	</head>  
  	<body>
  	<!the body is the actual physical display of the page>
  	<h1>My Awesome Website</h1>
  	<h2>It's great</h2>
  	<!heading elements - there are 6 of these elements, each decending in importance>
  	<!html is a whitespace insensitive language> 
  		<p>
  			Hello and welcome to my site. 
  			<a href= "http://www.google.com">
  			This is another Site
  			</a> 
  			<!this is an 'a' tag or an anchor tag; attribute href = hypertext reference,
  			 refers>
  			<!to something else, somewhere else â€“ you need http://, if you don't add 
  			<!this you have a valid name for any file, you don't change directories>
  			<!specifing the protocal, http:// you explicitly change directories>

  		You can write as much as you want.

  		<ul>
  		<!ul stands for unordered list>
  		<!you can't put a list in an p>
  			<li>Here's some text</li>
  			<li>Here's some text</li>
  			<li>Here's some text</li>
  			<!li stands for list item>

  		<ol type="i">
  		<!ol stands for ordered list, the type attribute changes the kind of ordering> 
  			<li>Here's some text</li>

  			<li>Here's some text</li>
